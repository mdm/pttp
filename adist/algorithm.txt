1) init all agents in same square
2) select point with maximum overlap
3) select agent closest to that point
4) sample along a circle with radius = agent radius
5) for each sample calculate overlap with polygon and keep samples above threshold (or top 3?)
6) for each sample calculate overlap with other agents keep minimum
7) move agent in that direction
8) perturb agent
